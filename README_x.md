### HeyaðŸ‘‹

I am Inan Evin, a software engineer focused on game & game engine tech. I make games, game tools, custom assets and most importantly [Lina Engine](https://github.com/inanevin/LinaEngine). I also develop other open-source content, such as low-level sub-libraries of Lina Engine, or tools for other engines such as Unity and Unreal. 

I am currently working as an engine programmer in Finland at [HypeHype](https://hypehype.com/announcement), a revolutionary cross-platform/mobile game engine & gaming platform.
